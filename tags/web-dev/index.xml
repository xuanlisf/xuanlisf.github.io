      <description>I want to create a living journal of some of the decisions I made to customize this site that could potentially help others looking to build something similar. This post will be updated every time I make a substantial change. Hopefully in the future, this will be my own version of the Way Back Machine.
May 2021 We&amp;rsquo;re Live! This is what the site looks like at launch. I have a ton of things on my to-do list of cosmetic changes, but I still need to figure out how to make these changes with Hugo.</description>
