      <description>&lt;p&gt;For people who don’t create websites regularly, the process of setting up a blog and writing consistently and figuring out how to use products like Hugo and GitHub can be daunting. I hope this can shed some light on what my setup is and provide some useful resources to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I’m writing this post because it’s been a few months since I’ve published a blog post and I’ve started to forget all of the necessary steps and commands. This post started out as a way of documenting the steps and specific commands in Terminal for Hugo and GitHub, but I figured it would be a good opportunity to write about my overall workflow as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to create a living journal of some of the decisions I made to customize this site that could potentially help others looking to build something similar. This post will be updated every time I make a substantial change. Hopefully in the future, this will be my own version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/web/&#34;&gt;Way Back Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-17-2021&#34;&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the font-size has been a bit of a pain. Unfortunately, the creator used a mix of absolute and relative font sizing in the CSS. So while some fonts scale up after changing the main font from size 14 -&amp;gt; size 16, others remained small. It took a bit of time to go through and update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
