      <description>Ok, so I&amp;rsquo;m not really an ABC (American Born Chinese). I was born in Beijing, but I came to the US when I was 5 so I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty close. I speak Mandarin / Chinglish mostly with my parents over the phone and sometimes at restaurants. I love watching Chinese movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos though sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the parts of the dialogue. I prefer having subtitles on even if I can comprehend most of it.</description>
