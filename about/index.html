    <h1 id="hi-im-xuan-pronounced-schwinn">Hi, I&rsquo;m Xuan <em>(pronounced Schwinn)</em></h1>
<p>I live in San Francisco and work as a Product Marketer at Lyft. I started this blog as a way to practice some of the web dev concepts I had learned for fun as well as write longer posts about various topics. I admire people who write consistently and are able to clearly articulate a certain idea or give me a glimpse of a different life. I figured this blog could be a good way to improve my writing skills and share some of the projects that I work on.</p>
<p>Some blogs that I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed in the past and present include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> - The standard for tech / startup essays</li>
<li><a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/">Paul Stamatiou</a> - Intersection of tech / design / photography</li>
<li><a href="https://dannychoo.com/archive/en">Danny Choo</a> - Though currently on a break, I loved following him on his entrepreneurship journey</li>
<li><a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/?offset=1460588688794">Minimally Minimal</a> - Also no longer being updated, but I looked forward to his industrial design thoughts. Also amazing photographs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the consumer space for my entire tech career across many roles - business development, growth marketing, product marketing. Given the relative &lsquo;newness&rsquo; of the product marketing role in tech companies, I hope to write more about my experience to help fellow PMMs and others who may be interested.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I&rsquo;m interested in many things - fatherhood, football, fine art, food, Formula 1 (ok enough with the f&rsquo;s), stand up comedy, video games, running, boxing, street photography, and many more. I&rsquo;ve never been the type to become extremely obsessed with just one thing. I seem enjoy stumbling upon a hobby, researching it and trying to understand why people love it, then falling in love with it myself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you have any comments or feedback!</p>
