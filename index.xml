      <description>One of my friends was looking to switch industries recently and mentioned that seeing all of the different marketing roles in Tech was pretty confusing for someone on the outside. The names of roles aren&amp;rsquo;t always consistent across companies and the job descriptions are generic enough that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell what type of work you&amp;rsquo;d be doing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to group the roles into larger buckets and give short descriptions of the work you&amp;rsquo;d do as a reference guide to those looking at marketing career pathways in Tech.</description>

      <description>I want to create a living journal of some of the decisions I made to customize this site that could potentially help others looking to build something similar. This post will be updated every time I make a substantial change. Hopefully in the future, this will be my own version of the Way Back Machine.

      <description>Ok, so I&amp;rsquo;m not really an ABC (American Born Chinese). I was born in Beijing, but I came to the US when I was 5 so I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty close. I speak Mandarin / Chinglish mostly with my parents over the phone and sometimes at restaurants. I love watching Chinese movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos though sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the parts of the dialogue. I prefer having subtitles on even if I can comprehend most of it.</description>

      <description>Pronounced Schwinn, like the bike I live in San Francisco and work as a Product Marketer at Lyft. I started this blog as a way to practice some of the web dev concepts I had learned for fun as well as write longer posts about various topics. I admire people who write consistently and are able to clearly articulate a certain idea or give me a glimpse of a different life.</description>
